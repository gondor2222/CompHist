function out = comphist(image, xsize, ysize, s, ref, ref2)
% COMPHIST Compute a fixed-window transform of an image into a competitive
% histogram score
%   IMAGE is the image to be scored
%   XSIZE is the width of the sliding window in pixels
%   YSIZE is the height of the sliding window in pixels
%   S is the resolution in window position, in pixels. Higher values
%       correspond to a lower-resolution scan and less accurate results
%   REF is a 32*32*32 hsv normalized histogram generated by hist3dhsv() on
%       the set of pixels formed from instances of the target class.
%   REF2 is the corresponding normalized histogram for pixels that are NOT
%       part of target class instances
%
%   OUT is a grayscale image of the same dimensions as IMAGE, with each
%       pixel containing a score from the comparison of REF and REF2 across
%       all passes. Positive scores mean the pixel is more likely to belong
%       to class REF, while negative scores mean the pixel is more likely
%       to belong to class REF2.
%   Note: many combinations of XSIZE, YSIZE, and S mean that pixels at the
%       bottom or very right of the image are not captured by any scan.
%       These pixels are set in OUT to a highly negative value, i.e. one
%       indicating non-membership in REF.
